As you've probably heard, this is a legendary course at UIUC. It's one of the most important and well-taught courses here. This course will open many internship opportunities for you, as many interview questions come straight from CS 225. I'd recommend taking this course in the spring semester of your freshman year, so that you will be prepared for the fall recruiting season. The first few weeks of the course will teach you some C++ fundamentals, but that will change soon (CS 126 will do this job instead). You should get comfortable with pointers and dynamic memory. Some MPs are harder than the others. MP3 is pretty hard if you're not comfortable with pointers. MP 5 to 7 are easy to code, but can be hard to understand the concepts at first. Start your MPs early, the queue can get pretty long when deadline gets close.
